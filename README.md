# Covid.track - spread simulator ü¶†

This project was used to create the simulations for a submission for the WirVsVirus hackathon.
As part of the Corona-Tracking challenge, we were conceptualizing an app, that can provide a "coronoa risk score" to you, which could alert of a potentially infection you before you even have symptoms.

In the simulation, we wanted to see the results of different scenarios
* people get infected but do not change their behavior, even if they have symptoms
* people start to stay at home, once they have symptoms
* people start to stay at home, once our app has alerted them

## How to start

Install all the project dependencies with:
```
npm install
```

And start the development server with:
```
npm run dev
```

## What it means

The screenshot is taken in the middle of the simulation, when the symptoms and alerted boxes are checked.

### Assumptions

For the simulation we assumed the following periods:
* total simulation ~ 8 weeks
* sickness period ~ 2.5 weeks
* symptoms ~ 1 week after infection
* alerted ~ 0.5 weeks after infection


## Browser support

This project is using EcmaScript Modules, therefore, only browsers with this compatibility will work. (Sorry Internet Explorer 11 and old Edge users).
